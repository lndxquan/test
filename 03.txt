The Pollution PremiumABSTRACTThis paper studies the asset pricing implications of industrial pollution. A long-short portfolio constructed from firms with high versus low toxic emission intensity within an industry generates an average annual return of 4.42%, which remains significant after controlling for risk factors. This pollution premium cannot be explained by ex- isting systematic risks, investor preferences, market sentiment, political connections, or corporate governance. We propose and model a new systematic risk related to en- vironmental policy uncertainty. We use the growth in environmental litigation penal- ties to measure regime change risk and find that it helps price the cross section of emission portfolios¡¯ returns.PRIOR FINANCE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT consumption and production influence expected stock returns. Little is known, however, about the role of their by-product¡ªindustrial pollution¡ªin asset pricing. On the one hand, polluting firms may save costs by not investing in emission abatement and environmental recovery in the short run. On the other hand, the negative externalities created by such firms are monitored by the general public, me- dia, and governments in the long run, and polluting firms could be subject to activist protests, litigation and reputational risk, and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities.1 Motivated by this gap in the literature, in this paper we empirically examine the pricing impact of industrial pollution.  Our investigation proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, we construct em- pirical proxies for firm-level pollutants and examine the cross-sectional vari- ation in the relation between stock returns and industrial pollution. In the second stage, we propose an extensive list of possible explanations for such return predictability and perform various tests to shed light on the true un- derlying mechanism.  To study the empirical relation between industrial pollution and expected stock returns at the firm level, we construct a measure of ¡°emission intensity¡± using pollution data from the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) database. Specif- ically, for each year over period 1991 to 2016, we first capture a firm¡¯s toxic emissions by summing the amount of emissions of all types of chemicals across all plants listed in the TRI database, a comprehensive database of mandatory pollution reports maintained by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Institutional background on the TRI database is provided in Section I.A in the Internet Appendix.2 We then calculate a firm¡¯s emission in- tensity as its ratio of toxic emissions to total assets: which we obtain from Com- pustat. Firms with higher emission intensity are associated with a higher fre- quency or probability of being involved in environment-related lawsuits. These firms are also associated with significantly higher contemporaneous profits.  We next assign firms to quintile portfolios based on their emission intensity relative to industry peers, given that chemical emissions tend to vary across industries. Such portfolio sorts show that firms producing more emissions are associated with higher subsequent stock returns: a high-minus-low (H-L) port- folio strategy that takes a long (short) position in the quintile portfolio with the highest (lowest) emission intensity yields a statistically significant average re- turn of 4.42% per annum. We also find that the significant alphas of the H-L portfolio are unaffected by known return factors for other systematic risks. In a cross-validation test, we perform Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions by introducing a wider set of controls and find that the emission-return relation remains economically and statistically significant irrespective of the control variables that we consider.
The Pollution Premium	3  To further examine whether such return predictability is related to environmental policies, we calculate quintile portfolio cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) in response to Donald Trump 2016 U.S. presidential election win.3 Following Trump¡¯s win, high-emission firms had significantly positive CARs that were higher than those of lower-emission counterparts. Specifi- cally, we find a monotonic pattern in CARs across quintile portfolios and a prominent contrast between the top portfolio (6.31%) and the bottom portfo- lio (3.64%) within a 10-day window around the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This finding supports the view that the general public¡ªand equity investors in particular¡ªpay attention to environmental policies and firm-level emissions.  We consider several possible explanations proposed in the literature for the cross-sectional variation in emission portfolios¡¯ returns, including existing sys- tematic risks, investors¡¯ preferences and underreaction, corporate governance, and political connections.4 Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions and two- way-sorted portfolios suggest that the emission-return relation is not elimi- nated when we control for firm characteristics related to these explanations. We also consider policy uncertainty exposures as in Bali, Brown, and Tang (2017) and show that the emission-driven return spread cannot be attributed to general policy uncertainty.  Given the results above, we propose a new systematic risk based on envi- ronmental policy uncertainty following P¨¢stor and Veronesi (2012, 2013) and develop a general equilibrium model in which firms¡¯ cash flows are subject to policy changes with respect to environmental regulation.5 In our model, the
4	The Journal of Finance?government acts as a social planner and considers the negative externality of toxic emissions. It optimally replaces the weak-regulation regime with the strong-regulation regime if environmental costs are sufficiently high (i.e., above a given endogenous threshold). Before the government makes its decision, agents learn about the welfare costs of toxic emissions under the weak-regulation regime in a Bayesian fashion by observing signals, which determines their perceived probability that the government will adopt strong-regulation regime. Adopting a strong-regulation regime will lower emissions but reduce firms¡¯ profitability. In particular, the profitability of high-emission firms drops more than that of low-emission firms, leading to a stronger negative impact on valuations of firms with high emission intensity. On the one hand, a shift to the strong regime is assumed to negatively affect economy-wide average profitability, which leads to an upward spike in the stochastic discount factor (SDF); on the other hand, since high-emission firms¡¯ profitability is more sensitive to such the regime shift than the profitability of low-emission firms, high-emission firms observe a larger stock price decline when a regime shift occurs and are more negatively exposed to the risk of a regulation regime shift, which results in higher average excess returns ex ante. Our model assumptions and predictions are supported by additional em- pirical tests. We first measure regime shift risk (i.e., the perceived likelihood of tighter environmental regulations) using the growth rate in the aggregate amount of all civil penalties level against pollution by the EPA.6 We find that when regime shift risk increases, firms with higher emissions experience a more pronounced decline in their long-term profits. When we use the general- ized method of moments (GMM) estimation of Cochrane (2005) to test the price of regime change risk (i.e., ¦Ëc) and the exposure to such risk of emission portfo- lios, we find that regime change risk is significantly negatively priced and that emission portfolios¡¯ betas on regime change risk decrease with emission inten- sity, both of which are consistent with the model. As a result, the H-L emission portfolio delivers higher expected returns because it has negative exposure toregime change risk that is negatively priced.  In sum, our emission intensity measure captures risk characteristics that are distinct from others documented in the literature, and our model identi- fies a new source of systematic risk for investors: the risk of a regime shift in environmental regulation that impacts high-emission firms more than low-emission firms. While we acknowledge that environmental regulation un- certainty is only one (particular) type of policy uncertainty, such uncertainty is a substantial yet under explored part of policy uncertainty. More importantly, JT difference test results show that our measure of environmental policy

Most of the papers in this literature focus on the economic consequences of global warming and climate change.7 Here, we focus instead on the asset pricing implications of environmental pol- icy changes.  Our work also adds to the literature that explores investment strategies related to climate change, CSR, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores. Prior studies in this literature can be classified into several classes: long-run risk, downside risk, attention, preferences, and cost of cap- ital. Climate change and environmental issues constitute long-run risks, and polluting firms therefore carry higher risk exposure (Bansal and Ochoa (2011), Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2016), Bolton and Kacperczyk (2019, 2020)).8 Some studies suggest that high-CSR firms are less risky because their CSR repu- tation helps them survive financial downturns (Lins, Servaes, and Tamayo (2017), Hoepner et al. (2019), and Albuquerque, Koskinen, and Zhang (2019)).9 In addition, investor under- or overreaction to news about pollution or climate change can result in return predictability (Kr¨¹ger (2015), Chen, Kumar, and Zhang (2019), Hong, Li, and Xu (2019)),10 and it is well known that investors are more willing to hold socially responsible firms and funds due to social repu- tation, or liquidity concerns, which also impact stock prices.11 Such preferences
6	The Journal of Finance?may also influence systematic risk exposure (Bansal, Wu, and Yaron (2019), P¨¢stor, Stambaugh, and Taylor (2021)).12 Heinkel, Kraus, and Zechner (2001), Chava (2014), and Hong, Wang, and Yang (2021) further show that firms asso- ciated with environmental concerns face high equity and debt financing costs. Distinct from most prior empirical studies in this direction, we derive regula- tion regime change risk in a general equilibrium setting, and we use actual toxic emissions, which are less subject to errors than estimations or surveys.  Our paper also adds a new perspective to asset pricing implications of macroeconomic uncertainty, a topic for which P¨¢stor and Veronesi (2012, 2013) provide a comprehensive literature review. Prior empirical studies examine the role of uncertainty in economic policy, politics and elections, and tax and fiscal conditions.13 Distinct from these papers, we explore the financial effect of uncertainty in environmental policies and regulations. Finally, our paper contributes to the literature that relates consumption or productivity risk to stocks¡¯ risk premium from the perspective of pollution, which is an unavoid- able by-product of production and consumption.14
The Pollution Premium	7The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section I, we discuss data construction and present summary statistics as well as our baseline results. In Section II, we discuss and empirically test several possible explanations for the positive emission-return relation that we document. In Section III, we examine how litigation risk and profits relate to emission intensity using an event study analysis. We describe an equilibrium model and analyze its quantitative asset pricing implications in Section IV. We further test our model and its testable implications in Section V. We conclude in Section VI. Details on data construction are provided in the Internet Appendix. The Internet Appendix also contains additional empirical evidence, details on our model solution, calibration and sensitivity analyses, and an extended model that introduces debt financing.I. Firm-Level Emissions and Pollution Premium  In this section, we first discuss our measurement of firm-level toxic emis- sions. We then examine the relation between toxic emissions and the cross sec- tion of stock returns. We show that emissions positively predict stock returns in one-way portfolio sorts and that such an emission-return relation is unaffected by known return factors for other systematic risks. In the third subsection, we implement Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions to examine whether the positive relation between emissions and stock returns is mitigated by other firm characteristics, and in the fourth subsection we double sort on size and emissions and confirm that the pollution premium is not driven by the size effect.A. Data Sources  To obtain firm-level emissions of U.S. public companies, we collect plant- level chemical pollutants data from the TRI database constructed and main- tained by the EPA.15 The TRI database contains detailed information on all
8	The Journal of Finance?U.S. chemical emissions at the plant level each year since 1986. Specifically, the TRI data contain report year, level of chemical pollutants in pounds, name of chemical categories, location Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code, and company names.16 While the TRI database has been a publicly avail- able since 1986, its coverage was fairly limited and contains data errors until 1990. As a result, we use the emission data from 1991 to 2016 to construct our emission-related variables.  Our sample consists of firms that lie in the intersection of Compustat, Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP), and the TRI database (Xiong and Png (2019)). We obtain accounting data from Compustat and stock price data from CRSP. Our sample firms include those with nonmissing TRI data and non- missing standard industrial classification (SIC) codes, as well as those with domestic common shares (SHRCD = 10 and 11) trading on NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ. We identify firms in our sample that were involved in litigation from Key Developments in Capital IQ. Following the literature, we exclude finan- cial firms that have four-digit SIC codes between 6000 and 6999 (e.g., finance,insurance, trusts, and real estate sectors). To mitigate backfilling bias, we re- quire that firms to be listed on Compustat for two years before we include them in our sample.  We collect civil cases about firms involved in environmental litigation from the Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) system provided by the EPA. Section I.B in the Internet Appendix details our procedure for quan- tifying environmental litigation. ECHO contains information on federal- and state-level administrative and judicial cases and tracks all formal administra- tive and judicial enforcement actions taken by the U.S. EPA. This database provides information on the dollar amount of penalties for pollution in each civil case in the EPA record. We search these civil cases in the database from 1990 to 2017. We then identify firms involved in litigation that is related to violations of environmental regulations and count the frequency of these cases for each firm and year.  Finally, we collect firm-level environmental scores from Thomson Reuters¡¯ ASSET4 Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance database.17 We use the environmental score (ENVSCORE) and its components, which are as- signed to a firm annually.
The Pollution Premium	9B. Summary Statistics  Table I, Panel A reports pooled summary statistics. Specifically, Panel A re- ports the pooled mean, median, standard deviation (Std), 5th percentile (P5), 25th percentile (P25), 75th percentile (P75), and 95th percentile (P95) of the variables of interest, as well as the valid number of observations for each vari- able. Our main variable, Emissions, is the sum of all emissions (in pounds) produced in all plants owned by firm i in year t ? 1 scaled by total assets (in million dollars). Because a firm¡¯s emissions in year t ? 1 are recorded in the TRI database and become public information by the end of September of year t, we scale its emissions by its total assets disclosed by the end of March of yeart. The emission data are discussed in more detail in Sections I.A and I.C of the Internet Appendix. The other variables include market capitalization (ME), book-to-market ratio (B/M), investment rate (I/K), return on assets (ROA), re- turn on equity (ROE), tangibility (TANT), a Whited and Wu (WW) index to cap- ture financial constraints, operating leverage (OL), and book leverage (Lev).18 We have a total of 9,989 firm-year observations with nonmissing emissions. The average Emissions is 6,568, suggesting that one million dollars in book assets is associated with 6,568 pounds of chemical emissions. Industry-level summary statistics for Emissions are presented in Section I.D in the InternetAppendix.  Table I, Panel B presents a correlation matrix for all of variables considered in Panel A. We find that Emissions is generally not highly correlated with the other variables, with the exception of its correlation coefficients with size (ME), asset tangibility (TANT), financial constraints (WW), and operating leverage (OL), which are ?0.03, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.07, respectively.  To shed light on whether some of the firm characteristics above predict firm Emissions, we run pooled regressions in which we regress the logarithm of firm-level emission intensity (Emissions) in year t + 1 on the logarithm of cur- rent emission intensity in year t, all firm characteristics in year t, and industry- year joint fixed effects. As shown in Table IA.1 in the Internet Appendix, we find that only firm size and asset tangibility have consistent predictive abil- ity for future emissions.19 Emission intensity significantly decreases with firm size and significantly increases with asset tangibility. These findings are intu- itive because firms with higher market value can rely more on intangible as- sets and thus are less dependent on manufacturing, while firms with more tan- gible assets are naturally more manufacturing-oriented.20 Below we conduct factor regressions, Fama-MacBeth regressions, and two-way portfolio sorts to
Table IStatistics and CorrelationsThis table presents summary statistics in Panel A and a correlation matrix in Panel B for the firm-year sample. Emissions are measured as the sum of all emissions in pounds produced in all plants owned by a firm, scaled by total assets (item AT) in million dollars. ME is market capitalization deflated by CPI (measured in 2009 millions USD) at the end of September. B/M is the ratio of book equity to market capitalization. I/K is capital expenditures (item CAPX) divided by property, plant, and equipment (PPENT). Return on assets (ROA) is operating income after depreciation (item OIADP) scaled by total assets. Return on equity (ROE) is operating income after depreciation scaled by total assets. Tangibility (TANT) is property, plant, and equipment divided by total assets. WW index (WW) is the Whited and Wu index used to measure financial constraint, following Whited and Wu (2006). Operating leverage (OL) is the summation of cost of goods sold (item COGS) and selling, general, and administrative expenses (item XSGA) scaled by total assets. Book leverage (Lev) is the summation of current liabilities (item DLC) and long-term debt (item DLTT) scaled by total assets. We report the pooled mean, standard deviation (Std), 5th percentile (P5), 25th percentile (P25), median, 75th percentile (P75), and 95th percentile (P95). Observations denote the valid number of observations for each variable. The sample period is 1991 to 2016 at an annual frequency.EmissionsMEB/MI/KROAROETANTWWOLLevPanel A: Summary StatisticsMean6,567.886,272.440.670.180.090.190.33?0.350.990.23Std44,586.4121,765.230.610.110.082.710.180.100.560.17P51.8047.440.160.06?0.02?0.100.09?0.510.240.00P2575.67362.960.350.110.050.120.19?0.420.620.15Median465.041,302.750.550.160.090.200.30?0.350.900.26P752,372.914,448.090.830.220.130.300.44?0.291.250.37P9523,254.8126,056.431.500.370.220.580.71?0.191.970.56Observations9,9899,6919,7369,9349,9899,9899,9899,6989,9899,973Panel B: CorrelationEmissions1?0.03?0.010.010.020.000.050.070.070.00ME1?0.110.030.050.020.00?0.41?0.170.07B/M1?0.19?0.37?0.110.160.1?0.020.09I/K10.220.00?0.270.160.16?0.24ROA10.16?0.10?0.050.13?0.20ROE1?0.02?0.020.040.12TANT1?0.21?0.230.21WW10.41?0.22OL1?0.18Lev1

Univariate Portfolio Sorting: Returns, Firm Characteristics, and Factor Regressions  To investigate the link between emissions and the cross section of stock re- turns, we construct quintile portfolios sorted on firms¡¯ emissions scaled by to- tal assets (AT) in Panel A, property, plant, and equipment (PPENT) in Panel B, sales (SALE) in Panel C, and market equity (ME) in Panel D, and report each portfolio¡¯s postformation average stock return. As mentioned above, be- cause the EPA updates each emission data by the end of September each year, we form portfolios at the end of each September in year t (from 1992 to 2017) (see Section I.A and Figure IA.1 in the Internet Appendix). Specifically, each year we first sort all sample firms with positive scaled emissions in year t ? 1 into five groups from low to high within the 49 Fama and French (1997) indus- tries. As a result, we have industry-specific break points for quintile portfolios for each September. We then assign all firms with positive scaled emissions in September of year t into quintile portfolios. The low (high) quintile portfolio contains firms with the lowest (highest) emissions in each industry. After form- ing the five portfolios sorts (from low to high), we calculate the value-weighted monthly returns on these portfolios over the next 12 months (i.e., October of year t to September of year t + 1). To examine the emission-return relation, we also form an H-L portfolio that takes a long position in the high-emission portfolio and a short position in the low-emission portfolio and calculate the return on this portfolio.In Panels A to D of Table II, the top row presents the annualized averageexcess stock return in percentage (E[R]-Rf, in excess of the risk-free rate), t- statistic, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio for the six portfolios we con- sider. The table shows that a firm¡¯s emissions forecast stock returns. Taking Panel A, which uses emissions scaled by total assets (our primary proxy of emission intensity), as an example, the quintile portfolio sorts from low to high have annualized excess returns of 6.90%, 9.68%, 9.08%, 9.11%, and 11.32%, re- spectively. More importantly, the H-L portfolio has an annualized excess return of 4.42% with a t-statistic of 3.66. In addition, the Sharpe ratios of the quin- tile portfolios are 0.45, 0.57, 0.58, 0.55, and 0.69, respectively, and that of the H-L portfolio is 0.46, which is comparable to the Sharpe ratio of the aggregate equity premium. Similar patterns obtain in other panels. The finding that the

The sample runs from October 1992 to September 2018 and excludes financial industries. We report average excess returns over the risk-free rate (E[R]-Rf), t-statistics, standard deviations (Std), and Sharpe ratios (SR) across five portfolios in each panel. Portfolio returns are value-weighted by firms¡¯ market capitalization, and are multiplied by 12 to make the magnitude comparable to annualized returns. t-Statistics are based on standard errors using the Newey-West correction for 12 lags.L234HH-LPanel A:ATE[R]-Rf (%)6.909.689.089.1111.324.42[t]2.022.912.842.733.303.46Std (%)15.3316.9415.6416.4616.309.53SR0.450.570.580.550.690.46Panel B: PPENTE[R]-Rf (%)7.878.608.669.3710.642.78[t]2.712.242.742.673.142.00Std (%)14.7717.3915.3416.7116.259.00SR0.530.490.560.560.660.31Panel C: SALEE[R]-Rf (%)7.4510.437.519.499.622.17[t]2.413.331.902.832.851.73Std (%)14.7116.0317.3317.3615.588.51SR0.510.650.430.550.620.25Panel D: MEE[R]-Rf (%)7.239.108.957.9412.445.21[t]2.392.602.701.993.732.63Std (%)14.7616.8616.0217.7316.6510.11SR0.490.540.560.450.750.52return on the H-L portfolio is economically large and statistically significant across all panels suggests significant predictive ability of firm-level emissions for stock returns.  Overall, Table II provides empirical evidence that firm-level emissions help explain subsequent stock returns. In the rest of our analyses, we focus on emis- sion intensity defined as annual emissions scaled by total assets and the asso- ciated portfolios.  Table III reports the average firm characteristics across quintile portfolios. We find that, on average, firms in the high-emission group generate emissions of 3,106,629 pounds per year, while firms in the low-emission group generate

Raw emissions are measured as the sum of all emissions in pounds produced in all plants owned by a firm. Emissions are measured as raw emissions in pounds scaled by total assets in million dollars.

In addition, the emission intensity of the high (low) group is 8,146.43 (15.52). We further find that high-emission firms are smaller and have higher asset tangibility as well as higher operating leverage, while there is little variation in B/M, I/K, ROA, financial constraints, and financial leverage across emission-sorted portfolios. These results confirm our earlier regression results.  In Table IV, we follow standard procedure and investigate the extent to which the variation in the average returns of the emission-sorted portfolios can be explained by existing risk factors. The table reports the alphas from the leading risk factor models, including the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), the Fama-French five-factor model (Fama and French (2015)), and the HXZ q-factor model (Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015)). We find that the cross-sectional return spread across portfolios sorted on emission intensity cannot be cap- tured by these risk factors, and the alphas in the long-short portfolio remain statistically significant. Therefore, the positive emission-return relation that we document cannot be attributed to common risk exposure.D. Fama-MacBeth Regressions and Double Sorting on Size  In Table V, we examine the emission-return relation by running Fama- MacBeth regressions to control for a variety of firm characteristics as described in Section II.B of the Internet Appendix. The results of these regressions are consistent with the results that obtain we sort portfolios on emission inten- sity, which show that emission intensity significantly positively predicts fu- ture stock returns. In addition, the predictability of emission intensity is not
Table IVAsset Pricing Factor TestsThis table shows asset pricing factor tests for five portfolios sorted on emissions scaled by total assets relative to their industry peers, for which we use the Fama and French (1997) 49-industry classifications and rebalance portfolios at the end of each September. The results reflect monthly data. The sample runs from October 1992 to September 2018 and excludes financial industries.

16	The Journal of Finance?Table VFama-MacBeth RegressionsThis table reports Fama-MacBeth regressions of individual stock excess returns on their emission intensity in logarithm and other firm characteristics. We conduct cross-sectional regressions for each month from October of year t to September of year t + 1. In each month, monthly returns of individual stock returns (annualized by multiplying by 12) are regressed on emission intensity in logarithm of year t ? 1 (that is reported by the end of September of year t), different sets of control variables known by the end of September of year t, and industry fixed effects. Control variables include the natural logarithm of market capitalization (Size), the natural logarithm of book-to-market ratio (B/M), investment rate (I/K), return on equity (ROE), tangibility (TANT), WW index, book leverage, and industry dummies based on Fama and French (1997) 49-industry classifications. All independent variables are normalized to zero mean and unit standard deviation after winsorization at the 1st and percentiles to reduce the impact of outliers. t-Statistics based on standard errors estimated using the Newey-West correction are reported.

We find that high-emission firms continue to outperform low-emission firms in stock returns for both large-firm and small-firm groups. We provide further discussion of these results in Section II.C of the Internet Appendix.II. Possible Explanations for the Pollution Premium  In this section, we examine whether the positive emission-return rela- tion can be attributed to any of several possible explanations, including
The Pollution Premium	17behavioral explanations, corporate policies and governance, and relevant risks documented in the literature. Due to space limitations, all tables are provided in the Internet Appendix.A. Behavioral ExplanationsA.1. Emissions Preferences  The literature documents that both retail and institutional investors disfa- vor firms with a poor social image, such as those that perform poorly with re- spect to CSR concerns.21 Prices of these firms therefore tend to be discounted by the market, resulting in higher dividend yields. In a context, when pollut- ing firms reduce their emissions in response to CSR concerns, their prices will be discounted less, resulting in a positive emission-return relationship. There may also exist investors who prefer high dividend yields to a stock¡¯s reputation. When these investors earn more dividends, they may buy more high-emission stocks, pushing up the prices of these stocks. In sum, the emission-return re- lation could be driven by investors¡¯ preferences on emissions.  To test this explanation, we measure institutional investors¡¯ ¡°emission pref- erences¡± and examine whether the emission-return relation varies across dif- ferent types of institutional investors.22 If the emission preference explanation holds, we expect emission-driven return predictability to be absorbed by insti- tutional investors¡¯ emission preferences. We control for emission preferences in our Fama-MacBeth regressions in column (1) Table IA.3 in the Internet Ap- pendix. The results show that emission intensity continues to significantly pos- itively predict future stock returns after controlling for emission preferences.  We also form double-sorted portfolios based on firm emissions and institu- tional investors¡¯ emission preferences.23 We present the average returns of our double-sorted (5 by 2) portfolios as well as t-statistics in Panel A of Table IA.5; we annualize portfolio returns by multiplying them by 12. In the high-
18	The Journal of Finance?emission-preference group, the H-L return spread based on emission-sorted portfolios is 4.98%, significant at the 1% level; in the low-emission-preference group, the H-L return spread based on emission-sorted portfolios is 4.72%, sig- nificant at the 5% level with a t-statistic of 2.03. These results suggest that the emission-related return predictability holds in the sample without emis- sion preferences, consistent with the main Fama-Macbeth regression results. Therefore, the pollution premium cannot be attributed to differences in in- vestor preferences with respect to pollution.A.2. Investor Underreaction to Emission Abatement  High-emission firms may be subject to greater pressure from the community and government and may be thus more likely to cut back emissions. However, the literature documents that investors may underreact to market news due to limited attention or a lag in information diffusion.24 If investors who prefer firms with a higher social image underreact to high-emission firms¡¯ reduction in emissions in the future, the stock prices of these firms may increase, re- sulting in the emission-return relation that we find. This explanation is not supported by Table IA.1, which shows a persistent pattern in firm-level emis- sions. That said, this table does not rule out the possibility that the pollution premium may be driven by a subset of high-pollution firms that significantly reduce their emissions in the future, leading subsequent stock prices to rise.  To provide further evidence on this possibility, we focus on firms in the high- est emission quintile portfolios that we further sort into two portfolios based on their emission intensity in year t (i.e., future emissions). The HL port- folio includes firms with future emission intensity below the median of the high group and the HH portfolio includes firms with future emission inten- sity above the median of the high group.25 If the underreaction explanation holds, the emission-return relation should be evident in the HL group but not in the HH group. Panel B of Table IA.5 presents the average portfolio return in the lowest quintile portfolio (L) as well as the return difference between the HL and L groups and the return difference between the HH and L groups. The empirical results show that although the HL-L difference is significantly positive on average (3.96% with a t-statistic of 3.31), the HH-L difference is also significantly positive on average (5.39% with a t-statistic of 2.34). In other words, even high-pollution firms that do not reduce their emissions in the fu- ture provide significantly higher returns than low-pollution firms. Hence, the
The Pollution Premium	19underreaction explanation is unlikely to explain the cross-sectional variation in stock returns due to emissions.A.3. Retail Investors¡¯ Behavioral Bias  In contrast to institutional investors who are more rational and have more complete information, retail investors may be subject to greater behavioral bias (See Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998), Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Sub- rahmanyam (1998), and Hong and Stein (1999), among others). For exam- ple, retail investors may panic in response to negative emission news (Kr¨¹ger (2015) and Ottaviani and S?rensen (2015)) and sell all their stock holdings at deep discounts. If such overreaction explains the pollution premium, we would expect the emission-return relation to exist only among stocks that experience a significant drop in the share of retail investors.  To test this explanation, we first conduct the percentage share of retail in- vestors as one minus the percentage share owned by institutional investors at the end of each quarter. We control for changes in retail investors¡¯ share (Share) in our Fama-MacBeth regressions in column (2) of Table IA.3. We find that emission intensity significantly positively predicts future stock re- turns, while the coefficient on changes in retail investors¡¯ share is statisti- cally insignificant. We next form double-sorted portfolios based on firm emis- sions and changes in retail investors¡¯ share. At the end of September of year t, we sort all stocks with emission intensity into three portfolios (30-40-30) based on the change in retail investors between June and September of year t within each industry. The high (low) group includes stocks that experience the strongest increase (decrease) in retail investors¡¯ share. Then, within each group, we further sort stocks into quintile portfolios based on firm emissions within an industry. Panel C of Table IA.5 shows that, for the middle tercile (Group 2), the return spread (4.08% with a t-statistic of 2.96) is significant and comparable to that in the univariate portfolio sorting, and the change in retail investors¡¯ share is close to zero (the mean and median are 0.05 and 0.04, respectively). In contrast, for other groups (Group 1 or 3, respec- tively) the lowest and highest changes in retail investors¡¯ share, the return spread (i.e., the return on the H-L portfolio) is insignificant. These results suggest that the emission-return relation is orthogonal to the ownership of retail investors, who are more subject to overreaction bias. As a result, the positive emission-return relation does not reflect retail investors¡¯ behavioral bias.B. Corporate Governance and Political ConnectionsB.1. Corporate Governance  Another possible explanation for the emission-return relation is that high-emission firms are subject to weaker governance or monitoring (Cheng, Hong, and Shue (2013), Masulis and Reza (2015), Glossner (2018),
20	The Journal of Finance?Hoepner et al. (2019)) and hence their stock prices are discounted by investors concerned about weak governance and the associated risk and uncertainty (e.g., Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003)). Such low prices may attract bid- ders or active investors who seek to these firms¡¯ governance and monitoring, in which case, stock prices show increase and lead to return predictability. If such channels are responsible for the emission effect, we would expect there to be no emission-return relation among firms with strong corporate governance. To test this explanation, we control for firms¡¯ G index and E index, respectively, in our Fama-MacBeth regressions in columns (3) and (4) of Table IA.3. We find that emission intensity continues to significantly positively predict future stock returns, while G index or E index loads insignificantly.  We also double sort firms¡¯ G index or E index into two portfolios (low and high) and firms¡¯ emission intensity into quintile portfolios (low, 2, 3, 4, and high), all relative to their industry peers.26 Panel A of Table IA.6 shows that returns on the H-L portfolio sorted on emission intensity remain statistically significant among firms in the strongest governance (i.e., low G index or E index) group. In particular, within the low G index group (upper panel), the H-L portfolio return is equal to 5.52%, significantly at 1% level. Therefore, our emission-return relation cannot be attributed to differences in governance and monitoring.B.2. Political Connections  It is also possible that high-emission firms may be more politically con- nected. Since political connections are positively related to future stock returns (e.g., Liu, Shu, and Wei (2017)), and results in a risk premium (Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2003)), the emission-return relation may, therefore, reflect the asset pricing implications of political connections. Under this explanation, we would expect there to be no emission-return relation among firms with low political connections.  To test this explanation, we collect annual firm-level political donation data from OpenSecrets.org maintained by the Center for Responsive Politics.27 We define a firm¡¯s political connections as the total amount of its political donation (regardless of party) in a year scaled by total assets.28 We control for political donations in our Fama-MacBeth regressions in columns (5) and (6) of Table IA.3. We find that emission intensity significantly positively predicts future stock returns, while political donations do not. We also double sort firms by political connections into portfolios (low and high) and by emission intensity into five portfolios (low to high). Panel B of Table IA.6 shows that returns on the H-L portfolio sorted on emission intensity are statistically significant in   26 Detailed information on the G index and E index comes from Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003) and Bebchuk, Cohen, and Ferrell (2008), respectively.27 This database is used by Bertrand, Bombardini, and Trebbi (2014) to measure firms¡¯ lobby-ing activities.   28 If a firm with positive emission intensity does not make any political contributions, we set its political connections to zero.
The Pollution Premium	21both political donation groups. The return spread is as high as 6.20% (with a t-statistic of 2.29) in low political donation group, which is even larger than the return spread of 4.26% (with a t-statistic of 4.85) in the high political donation group and the return spread of 4.42% in the univariate portfolio. These results indicate that political connections cannot explain the pollution premium.C. Existing Systematic Risks  We also explore possible explanations based on systematic risks posited in prior studies. In particular, we consider four alternative channels that may drive variations in our emission-sorted portfolios: technology obsolescence (Lin, Palazzo, and Yang (2020)), financial constraints (Li (2011), Lins, Servaes, and Tamayo (2017)), economic and political uncertainty (Brogaard and Detzel (2015), Bali, Brown, and Tang (2017)), and adjustment costs (Kim and Kung (2016), Gu, Hackbarth, and Johnson (2017)). The rationale for these expla- nations in a context is as follows. High-emission firms employ more obsolete technology as they invest less in advanced production capital. The arrival of new technology forces these firms to upgrade their production capital, and hence their cash flows are likely sensitive to frontier technology shocks. In addition, high-emission firms may be subject to financial constraints due to litigation and penalties related to environmental issues. High-emission firms may also be more subject to risk associated with macroeconomic uncertainty, such as economic downturns or trade conflicts, and political uncertainty, such as changes of the ruling party. Finally, high-emission firms may deliver higher expected returns because it is costly for them to adjust their capital stock, es- pecially during economic downturns.C.1. Technology Obsolescence  To capture firm-level technology obsolescence, we follow Lin, Palazzo, and Yang (2020) and employ both capital age and the I/K. A firm with older cap- ital or a lower investment rate faces higher exposure to technology frontier shocks and hence is more exposed to risk. We control for capital age and I/K in our Fama-MacBeth regressions in columns (7) and (8), respectively, of Table IA.3. We find that emission intensity significantly positively predicts future stock returns. We also implement two-way sorting. In Panel A of Table IA.7, we show that the H-L emissions return spread is comparable to that in the univariate portfolio sort in both of the capital age and both of the I/K groups. Specifically, the return spread is 4.07% (with a t-statistic of 2.44) in the young capital age group and 4.24% (with a t-statistic of 2.50) in the old capital age group, and it is 4.16% (with a t-statistic of 4.28) in the low I/K group and 5.31% (with a t-statistic of 3.22) in the high investment rate group. If technology ob- solescence is the main force driving the pollution premium, we should observe significant return spreads only in the old capital age and low investment rate groups. In contrast, the return spreads are significant in the young capital age
22	The Journal of Finance?and high I/K groups. Therefore, the pollution premium cannot be explained by technology obsolescence.C.2. Financial Constraints  To test the role of financial constraints, we employ the financial constraints measures of the WW index (Whited and Wu (2006)) and Size-Age (SA) index (Hadlock and Pierce (2010).)29 A higher value of the SA or WW index sug- gests that the firm is likely subject to greater financial constraints. We con- trol for the SA index and the WW index in columns (9) and (10), respectively, in our Fama-MacBeth regressions in Table IA.3. We find that emission in- tensity continues to significantly positively predict future stock returns. In Panel B of Table IA.7, we further show that the return spread from emis- sions is significantly positive in both less and more financially constrained groups. The fact that financially unconstrained firms¡¯ emissions still predict stock returns suggests that financial constraints cannot explain the pollution premium.C.3. Economic and Political Uncertainty  To measure the exposure to political and macroeconomic uncertainty, we estimate the firm-level exposure using rolling window regressions, following Bali, Brown, and Tang (2017) to estimate firm-level exposure to the macroe- conomic uncertainty index based on Jurado, Ludvigson, and Ng (2015) and the political uncertainty index based on Bloom (2009).30 We control for firm- level exposure to macroeconomic uncertainty (UNC Beta) and political uncer- tainty (EPU Beta) in columns (11) and (12), respectively, in our Fama-Macbeth regressions of Table IA.3. We find that emission intensity continues to sig- nificantly positively predict future stock returns. We also implement two-way sorts. The left and right sides of Table IA.7, Panel C present the returns of the 12 portfolios sorted on macroeconomic uncertainty and political uncer- tainty, respectively. Within both high and low macroeconomic or political un- certainty exposure groups, the return spreads sorted on emission intensity are significantly positive. These findings suggest that the emission-return rela- tion is not driven by different levels of exposure to macroeconomic or political uncertainty.   29 Detailed information on the construction of the SA and WW indexes can be obtained from Farre-Mensa and Ljungqvist (2016).30 For each stock with positive emissions in each month in our sample, we estimate the un-certainty exposure from monthly regressions of excess returns on the macroeconomic uncertainty index over a 60-month rolling window controlling for empirical risk factors, including the mar- ket (MKT), size (SMB), value (HML), momentum (UMD), liquidity (LIQ), investment (I/A), and profitability (ROE).
The Pollution Premium	23C.4. Adjustment Costs  We follow Kim and Kung (2016) and Gu, Hackbarth, and Johnson (2017) to measure a firm¡¯s asset redeployability and inflexibility, respectively.31 If the adjustment costs of asset redeployability (inflexibility) drive the pollution premium, we would expect such a premium not to exist in firms with the high asset redeployability (low inflexibility), which is associated with lower adjustment costs. We control for asset redeployability and inflexibility in our Fama-MacBeth regressions in columns (13) and (14), respectively, of Table IA.3 and find that emission intensity again significantly positively predicts future stock returns. When we implement two-way sorts in Panel D of Table IA.7, the emission-return relation appears significantly positive in both high-asset- redeployability and low-inflexibility groups, which suggests that the return predictability we document is unrelated to systematic risk associated with ad- justment costs.  Overall, we find that high-emission firms earn higher stock returns than low-emission firms in all groups with less exposure to systematic risks, as doc- umented in the literature. These results thus point to the unique role that emissions play with respect to return predictability.III. Additional Empirical Evidence  In this section, we examine the association between firm-level emissions and environmental litigation and profits. We also examine whether the emission- return relation is related to Trump¡¯s U.S. presidential election win on Novem- ber 8, 2016, which is an exogenous event with respect to environmental poli- cies.A. Environmental Litigation  To check that our emission intensity measure is a valid proxy for firms¡¯ pol- lution, we examine whether firms with higher emission intensity have a sig- nificantly higher probability of facing litigation for pollution.  To do so, We begin by collecting all federal- and state-level cases against pollution to obtain a more accurate estimate of the probability of litigation associated with environmental issues.32 Using these data, we estimate the re- gression          Ni,t+5 = a + b1 ¡Á Emissionsi,t + c ¡Á Controlsi,t + ¦Åi,t,	(1)where the left-hand-side variable denotes firm i¡¯s future litigation status. Specifically, Ni,t+5 is defined as a binary variable that indicates whether a firm is involved in litigation or as a count variable that reflects the total number of   31 Detailed information on the construction of the asset redeployability index is provided in Table IA.7.32 More details about these data sources are provided in Section I.B of the Internet Appendix.
24	The Journal of Finance?lawsuits from year t + 1 to year t + 5. When we use binary measure, we esti- mate equation (1) using a Probit regression; when we use count variable, we estimate equation (1) using a Poisson count and negative binomial regression, respectively. We control for a firm¡¯s fundamentals, including size, B/M, I/K, current profitability, TANT, financial constraints, book leverage, and operating leverage in year t. We also include industry-year fixed effects.33  In Table VI, we find that emissions in all predictive regressions significantly positively predict environmental-related lawsuits in all specifications. In our sample, 26% of firms will be sued for environmental issues in the following five years, and an average firm will be involved in 1.56 lawsuits in the follow- ing five years. The coefficients suggest that a one-standard-deviation increase in emission intensity is associated with a 16.20% higher probability or 2.46 times higher frequency of litigation. Such an increase in litigation probabil- ity or frequency is value-relevant because the mean and standard deviation of penalties are as high as 1.57 and 8.93 million dollars (real), respectively. These results indicate that our emission intensity well captures firm-level pollution as it predicts firms¡¯ likelihood of experiencing environmental litigation.B. Current Cash Flows (Profitability)  We next examine the relation between firm-level emissions and profits by estimating the OLS regression          ROAi,t = a + b1 ¡Á Emissionsi,t + c ¡Á Controlsi,t + ¦Åi,t,	(2)where ROAi,t is firm i¡¯s profitability as measured by ROA, Emissionsi,t denotes firm i¡¯s emission intensity in year t, and control variables include lagged ROA in year t ? 1, size, B/M, I/K, lagged profitability, TANT, financial constraints, Lev, and OL in year t, as well as industry-year fixed effects.34 Specifications(1) and (2) of Table VII show that the estimated coefficient on Emissions (b1) is significantly positive, suggesting that high-emission firms enjoy higher cur- rent profitability by saving on pollution abatement and environmental recov- ery costs.   33 Standard errors are clustered at the industry-year level to accommodate within-industry variation (Specifications (1) and (3)) or at the firm level to accommodate firm-level autocorrela- tion (Specifications (4) to (6)).

We standard- ize all explanatory variables to facilitate interpretation of economic magnitudes. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level to accommodate firm-level autocorrelation (Specification (1)) or at the industry-year level to accommodate within-industry variation (Specification (2)). We include industry-year fixed effects in Table VII for current and future profitability for the following rea- sons. First, it is well known that industry-specific, time-varying competition, business cycles, or technological development influence the profits of all firms in an industry (Giroud and Mueller (2010)). Second, in an unreported test, we add industry-average ROA (excluding the focal firm) as a control variable in all regressions of Table VII and find that it carries significantly positive coefficients, which supports industry-specific, time-varying trends in firm-level ROA.

In Panel A, we report panel regressions of future and current profitability on their emission intensity, litigation shocks, and their interactions, together with other firm characteristics in year t, where future profitability refers to moving-average profitability from year t + 1 to t + 10. The sample excludes financial industries. We control for industry-year fixed effects based on Fama and French (1997) 49-industry classifications. We measure litigation shocks (iln) using the log difference (i.e., growth rate) of civil penalties provided by the EPA. All independent variables are normalized to zero mean and unit standard deviation after winsorization at the 1st and 99th percentiles to reduce the impact of outliers. t-Statistics based on standard errors that are clustered at the firm level or at the industry-year level are reported. In Panel B, we show the cash flow sensitivity of emission-sorted portfolios to the litigation shock. Portfolio-level cash flow refers to future profitability as used in Panel A. We regress portfolio-level future profitability on litigation shocks together with other firm characteristics, and then report estimated coefficients on cash flow. Coefficients on litigation shocks are multiplied by 100. Standard errors are estimated using Newey-West correction. All regressions are conducted at the annual frequency.

Event Study  To provide additional evidence on whether the emission-return relation is related to environmental policies, we analyze stock price reactions on the date of Trump¡¯s U.S. presidential election win on November 8, 2016 as a prominent environmental policy shock, following Ramelli et al. (2021), Brown and Huang (2020), and Child et al. (2021).36 To isolate the impact of new information on stock prices, we consider CARs calculated with respect to the CAPM.37 We then compute the average CAR of all stocks in each quintile portfolio (based on firms¡¯ emission intensity at the end of September 2016) in response to the presidential election and include them in Table IX.  The CARs of emission-sorted portfolios display a largely monotonic increas- ing pattern from the lowest to the highest portfolios in relation to the U.S. presidential election event. In addition, the difference in CARs for stocks in   36 Di Giuli and Kostovetsky (2014) also show that firms with low social responsibility scores provide significantly positive 3-day CARs after Republican election victories. The authors in Ace- moglu et al. (2016b) document positive CARs for financial firms connected with Timothy Geithner following his nomination for U.S. Treasury Secretary in 2008. Wagner, Zeckhauser, and Ziegler (2018) present evidence of positive spikes in stock prices among firms with high tax burdens fol- lowing the 2016 U.S. presidential win. Brown and Huang (2020) find that firms with connections to the Obama administration experienced lower stock returns following Trump¡¯s victory. Child et al. (2021) show that firms with presidential ties enjoyed greater CARs around the 2016 election.37 Following standard practice in the literature, we adopt a 250-trading day estimation windowending 25 days prior to the event day. To do so, we first calculate the market-adjusted CAR of each stock over one date after the U.S. presidential election to 10 days after the event date, which we refer to as the (0,10) window.
The Pollution Premium	29the lowest and highest portfolios is sizable at 66.97% in annualized terms, significant at the 5% level. This result suggests that the stock market per- ceived the 2016 U.S. presidential outcome as good news for high-emission firms, anticipating that environmental regulations were likely to be relaxed. High-emission firms therefore retain their profitability advantage when weak regulation regimes are confirmed, with their stock prices reacting positively. More importantly, this finding indicates that the documented emission-return relation is indeed related to governments¡¯ environmental regulation policies. This result calls for more theoretical work.IV. A General Equilibrium Model  Given the pollution premium and several interesting empirical patterns that we document above, we next build a general equilibrium asset pricing model that features risk related to environmental policy regime shifts to explain the role that industrial pollution plays with respect to expected stock returns. Our specification of policy regime shifts is similar to that of P¨¢stor and Veronesi (2012, 2013). The basic intuition is that high-emission firms are more exposed to risks of environmental policy regime change and therefore require higher expected returns as compensation.A. The Model Economy  Production. We consider an economy with a finite horizon [0, T] and a con- tinuum of firms i ¡Ê [0, 1]. Let Bi denote firm i¡¯s capital at time t. Debt financing is not taken into account¡ªfirms in our economy rely entirely on equity financ- ing.38 Therefore, firm i¡¯s total capital equals Bi. At time 0, all firms are endowed with the same amount of capital, which we normalize to Bi = 1. Firm i invests its capital in a linear production technology with a stochastic rate of return denoted by dITi. All profits are reinvested, so that firm i¡¯s capital dynamics are given by dBi = BidITi. Since dITi equals profits over capital, we refer to itt	t	t	tas the profitability or ROA of firm i. For all t ¡Ê [0, T], profitability follows the processdITi = (¦Ì + ¦Î ig)dt + ¦Ò dZt + ¦ÒIdZi,	(3)t	twhere (¦Ì, g,¦Ò, ¦ÒI ) are observable and constant parameters, Zt is a Brownian motion, and Zi is an independent Brownian motion that is specific to firm i. The parameter g denotes the impact of different environmental policy regimes (i.e., weak- or strong-regulation regimes) on mean profitability process across firms. When g = 0, the environmental policy regime is ¡°neutral¡± with zero im- pact on firm i¡¯s profitability.   38 In Section IV of the Internet Appendix, we further extend our model to explicitly allow for regime-switching debt financing. We show that this additional channel amplifies the emission- return relation.
30	The Journal of Finance?  The impact of an environmental policy regime shift, g, is constant when the regime is not changed. At time ¦Ó (i.e., 0 < ¦Ó < T), the government makes an irreversible decision as to whether to change its environmental policy from the weak regulatory regime to the strong regulatory regime. As a result, g is a simple step function over time,
g =	gW	for t > ¦Ó if no policy regime shift occurs??gS	for t > ¦Ó if a policy regime shift occurs,
(4)
where gW denotes the impact of environmental policy under the weak- regulation regime at the onset. An environmental policy change replaces the weak regulation, denoted by W, by the strong regulation, denoted by S. Such a policy decision replaces gW by gS, inducing a permanent change in firms¡¯ av- erage profitability. We further assume that firms with different levels of emis- sion intensity have heterogeneous exposure to the environmental policy regime shift, as captured by the parameter ¦Î i. We assume that ¦Î i is positively propor- tional to firms¡¯ emission intensity and is drawn from a uniform distribution on the interval [¦Îmin,¦Îmax] at time 0 after which it remains unchanged. For now, we take ¦Î i to be exogenously given. In Section IV.E, we discuss how emission intensity is endogenously chosen ex ante by firm i. Without loss of generality, we normalize the distribution of ¦Î i, which has a mean equal to one. As we de- tail in Section V of the Internet Appendix, we calibrate the parameters such that gS < 0 < gW and establish the interval of ¦Î as [0,2].39This setup together with its calibrated parameters has two implications.First, as gS < gW and ¦Î i has unit mean, the environmental policy change from the weak- to the strong-regulation regime has an adverse effect on average profitability in the economy.  Second, the parameter ¦Î i governs the heterogeneous exposure of firms¡¯ prof- itability with respect to regime change risks across firms with different levels of emission intensity. Suppose that there are two firms: a high-emission firm (¦Î H) and a low-emission firm (¦Î L, such that ¦Î L < ¦Î H). Owing to lower abate- ment costs under the weak regime, a high-emission firm¡¯s average profitabil- ity is higher than that of a low-emission firm by the magnitude gW(¦Î H ? ¦Î L). This assumption is consistent with the empirical evidence in Section III.B: that high-emission firms enjoy higher current ROA than their low-emission counterparts, as take on fewer costs of pollution abatement and environmen-tal recovery. In stark contrast, because gS < 0, high-emission firms¡¯ average profitability drops more than low-emission firms under the strong-regulation regime.40 As another piece of suggestive evidence, in Section V.B we show that, upon the arrival of policy change shocks that increase the perceived   39 In Section V of the Internet Appendix, we show that such calibration allows our model to re- produce a monotonically increasing pattern of firms¡¯ current profitability (ROA) and a flat pattern of firms¡¯ future ROA, consistent with our data.40 For this assumption, we present supportive evidence in Section V of the Internet Appendix forthe quantitative implication. In particular, we show that although high-emission firms¡¯ current
The Pollution Premium	31likelihood of a regime shift, high-emission firms¡¯ future ROA drops more than that of low-emission firms. As we discuss below, the cross-sectional dispersion in firms¡¯ emission intensity, ¦Î is, by the assumption above is an important factor in generating heterogeneous firms¡¯ exposure to aggregate regime changes and therefore in determining different risk premia across emission-sorted portfo- lios in equilibrium.  The firms are owned by a continuum of identical households that maximize expected utility derived from terminal wealth.41 For all j ¡Ê [0, 1], investor j¡¯s utility function is given by
U (W j ) =
(W j )1?¦Ã1 ? ¦Ã

where W j is investor j¡¯s wealth at time T and ¦Ã > 1 is the coefficient of rela- tive risk aversion. At time 0, all investors are equally endowed with the same shares of firm stocks. Stocks pay dividends at time T.42 Households observe whether regime shifts occur at time ¦Ó .  When making its policy decision at time ¦Ó , the government maximizes the same objective function as households, except that it internalizes the negative externalities of pollution as the environmental cost ¦Á(c) if the economy is un- der the weak environmental regulation regime. The government commits to a change in environmental policy only if the government¡¯s expected utility un- der the strong regulation is higher than that when under the weak regulation. Specifically, the government solves the optimization problem

We assume that the environmental cost c is unknown to all agents until time ¦Ó and follows a prior distribution as in equation (7). We refer to ¦Òc as regime shift uncertainty.ROA is higher, their average future ROA is similar to that of their low-emission counterparts. This implies that high-emission firms¡¯ ROA tends to be more negatively affected than that of low- emission firms when strong regulation is enacted with some positive probability.41 This setting is consistent with our empirical design of scaling emissions by total assets.   42 No dividends are paid before time T because households¡¯ preferences do not involve interme- diate consumption. Firms in our model reinvest all of their earnings, as mentioned above.
32	The Journal of Finance?Due to the uncertainty about environmental costs before time ¦Ó , stock prices respond to environmental cost signals, as we show* in Section III.C.B. Learning about Environmental Costs  The environmental cost c is unknown to all agents until time ¦Ó . At time t < ¦Ó , agents start to learn about c by observing unbiased signals. We model these signals as the true value of signals plus noise, which takes the following form in continuous time:dst = cdt + dZc.	(8)The signal dst is assumed to be independent of other shocks in the economy. We refer to these shocks as environmental cost signals, and note that they capture the steady flow of news related to environmental issues that are of concern to both the media and regulatory authorities. Combining the signals in equation (8) with the prior distribution in equation (7), we obtain the posterior distribution of c at any time t < ¦Ó ,c ?

Equation (10) shows that agents¡¯ beliefs about c are driven by the Brownian motion shocks dZ?c, which reflect the differences between the cost signals dst and their expectations (dZ?c = dst ? Et[dst]). Since the cost signals are inde- pendent of all fundamental shocks in the economy (i.e., dZt and dZi), the inno-vations dZ?c represent signal shocks to the true value of environmental costs. These shocks shape agents¡¯ beliefs about which environmental policy is likely to be adopted in the future, above and beyond the effect of fundamental eco- nomic shocks. Accordingly, we refer to such signal shocks as regime change risks. Later, we emphasize that these shocks command a risk premium in equi- librium. Moreover, since firms with different levels of emission intensity have heterogeneous exposure to regime shifts, they exhibit different levels of risk compensation with respect to regime change risks.C. Optimal Regulation Regime Changes  After a period of learning about c, the government decides whether to change policy regime at time ¦Ó . If the government changes the policy regime, then the

Since a regime change permanently affects future profitability, the two expec- tations in equation (12) are determined by different stochastic processes for  According to Lemma A.1 in Section III.A of the Internet Appendix, the in- equality can be further simplified into a rule that explains the policy regime change, as we show in the following proposition.PROPOSITION 1: A regulation regime change occurs at time ¦Ó if and only ifc(¦Ó ) < c,	(13)

First, using the growth in civil penalties as a proxy for regime change shocks, we show that such shocks that increase the perceived probability of a regime change lead to negative changes in asset prices. Second, Corollary 1 is consistent with our finding in Section III.C: upon Trump¡¯s U.S. presidential victory as a negative regime change shock, the per- ceived probability of switching to a strong policy regime is revised downward.   43 The aggregation of capital at time T is further derived in Section III.A of the Internet Appendix.
34	The Journal of Finance?Thus, high-emission firms¡¯ stock prices react more positively to these events than to those of low-emission firms.D. Asset Pricing Implications  In this section, we derive the asset pricing implications of regime change risks as follows. First, we show the impact of regime change risks on the state price density. Second, we show how stock prices vary with fundamental shocks and regime change shocks. Finally, we decompose firms¡¯ risk premia into risk compensation to fundamental shocks and risk compensation to regime change shocks. We find that the heterogeneity in firms¡¯ emission intensity translates into cross-sectional differences in expected stock returns with respect to regime change risks.D.1. State Price Density  Our main focus is on the response of stock prices before regime shift uncer- tainty is resolved at time ¦Ó . Before time ¦Ó , agents learn about the environmen- tal cost under weak regulation. This learning generates stochastic variation in the posterior mean of c according to equation (8), which represents a stochastic state variable that affects asset prices before time ¦Ó . In contrast, the posterior variance of c varies deterministically over time as in equation (9).  The dynamics of the state price density ¦Ðt are essential for understanding the source of risks in this economy.44 An application of Ito¡¯s Lemma to ¦Ðt de- termines the SDF as shown in Proposition 2.PROPOSITION 2: The SDF follows the processd¦Ðt = Et¡ºd¦Ðt l ? ¦ËdZt ? ¦Ëc tdZ?c,	(17)where the price of risk for fundamental shocks is given by¦Ë = ¦Ã¦Ò,	(18)and the price of risk for uncertainty shocks is given by¦Ëc =  1 ?¦Ãt ¦Ò? 2 ¦Ç?1 < 0.	(19),t	¦Ãt ?c?t  c,tProof: See the Proof of Proposition 2 in the Internet Appendix.  Equation (17) shows that the prices of risk ¦Ë and ¦Ëc,t measure the sensitivity of the SDF with respect to fundamental shocks and regime change shocks. Fun- damental shocks are represented by the Brownian motion dZt, which drives44 We determine the level of the state price density in Section III.D of the Internet Appendix.
The Pollution Premium	35the aggregate fundamentals (profitability) of the economy. The first term of the SDF shows that fundamental shocks affect the SDF in the same way when all parameters are known. The second type of shocks consists of regime change shocks. Although unrelated to fundamental shocks (i.e., dZt ¡¤ dZ?c,t = 0), regime change shocks affect expected utility by affecting the perceived probability of a regime change and hence are priced. Equation (19) shows that regime change shocks impact the SDF more when the sensitivity of marginal utility to varia- tion in c?t is larger (i.e., ?¦Ãt/?c?t is larger) and when the posterior variance ¦Ò?c,t is larger. As we prove in the Internet Appendix, the sign of ¦Ëc,t is negative. Thus, upon a positive regime change shock, both the marginal value of wealth and the state price of density increase and hence regime change shocks carry a negative price of risk.D.2.

To characterize the risk compensation for fundamental shocks and regime change shocks, we derive the expression for the conditional risk premium. In particular, firm i¡¯s expected stock return equals its risk premia,

The first term captures the risk premium of fundamental shocks and is homogeneous across firms. The risk premium of regime change shocks is given by the second term of equa- tion (23). As we show in Propositions 2 and 3, upon a positive regime change shock, stock prices decrease precisely when the marginal utility¡ªand thus the SDF¡ªis high. Thus, agents demand positive compensation for their exposure to such regime change shock.  More importantly, the heterogeneous risk compensation for regime change risks is responsible for the cross-sectional difference in expected returns across firms with different levels of emission intensity. As shown in equation (22),firm i¡¯s risk exposure to a regime change shock (i.e., ¦Âi ) depends negativelyon its emission intensity ¦Îi. When the regulatory regime changes, stock values of high-emission firms with high ¦Î decrease more than do those of low-emission firms. Heterogeneous levels of exposure to regime change risks translate into cross-sectional differences in expected stock returns. Our model predicts that high-emission firms require a higher expected return than do low-emission firms. This prediction is strongly supported by a statistically significant H-L return spread among emission-sorted portfolios. We refer to this return spread as the pollution premium.E. Endogenous Decision to Choose Emission Intensity  In this section, we endogenize firm i¡¯s decision to choose emission intensity ¦Î i. Our key idea is to introduce a trade-off between firm value and costly emission abatement. Based on our previous benchmark model, due to a higher discount rate (i.e., the pollution premium), choosing a higher emission inten- sity leads to a lower valuation (i.e., market-to-book ratio). As a trade-off for a lower valuation, a higher emission intensity leads to lower abatement costs. For model tractability, we consider a static decision whereby firm i chooses ¦Î i at time 0 and maintains the same emission intensity until terminal time T.Firm value immediately after the choice of ¦Î i is given by Mi ¡Ô Mi /Bi , where
Bi =

The Pollution Premium	37Section V of the Internet Appendix, a firm¡¯s valuation decreases in its emission intensity at a decreasing rate. By using the log-linear approximation around the average ¦Î i, denoted by ¦Î0, firm i¡¯s marginal value with respect to ¦Î i can be express asMi0 ¡Ö ?¦Ø0 + ¦Ø1¦Î i,	(24)?¦Îiwhere ¦Ø0 > 0 and ¦Ø1 > 0 are the Taylor expansion parameters evaluated at¦Î0, which are provided in Section III.G of the Internet Appendix. We focus on
¦Î i < ¦Îmax ¡Ô ¦Ø01
so that the marginal value is negative (i.e.,  ?Mi
< 0). This im-
plies that a higher ¦Î i reduces a firm¡¯s value, mainly due to a higher discount rate to reflect the pollution premium. In addition, ¦Ø1 > 0 implies that firm i¡¯s valuation decreases at a slower rate as ¦Î i increases.We denote firm i¡¯s abatement cost by \Ii ¡Ô \I0(¦Î i; ¦Çi), paid at time 0. We di-rectly specify the marginal abatement cost with respect to emission intensity¦Î i as

where ¦Î? is the emission intensity when it incurs zero marginal abatement cost. We assume that a firm¡¯s marginal cost depends on firm characteristic ¦Çi. This assumption has two important implications. First, over the range ¦Î i ¡Ê [0, ¦Î?], the marginal abatement cost is negative, which implies a benefit of abatement cost savings when allowing a higher level of emissions. Second, it is increas- ingly costly to further reduce emissions when emission intensity is low. The marginal abatement cost increases to ¦Ø1¦Çi¦Î? as firm i¡¯s emission intensity ap- proaches zero.  Firm i determines its level of emission intensity by maximizing its stock price subject to abatement cost \Ii :max Mi ? \Ii .

The intuition behind the above proposition is as follows. First, when we assume ¦Î? < ¦Îmax, the optimal emission intensity ¦Î i? in equation (28) must exist over the range [0, ¦Î?]. Second, since the marginal cost of reducing emission intensity increases in ¦Çi, a firm with a higher ¦Çi chooses a higher optimal emission intensity at the optimum. Second, when we assume ¦Î? < ¦Îmax, the optimal level of emission intensity ¦Î i? in equation (28) must exist over the range [0, ¦Î?]. In the extreme case, the optimal level of emission intensity ¦Î i? converges to the ¦Î? with zero abatement cost as ¦Çi goes to infinity. The intuition is that an infinitely high marginal abatement cost motivates firm i to choose the maximum emission intensity level. Finally, the marginal abatement cost is heterogeneous across firms. Because firms with higher ¦Çi optimally choose higher levels of emis- sion intensity, we can prove that they pay a lower overall abatement cost than firms with lower ¦Çi. In this study, we do not intend to endogenize the cross- sectional heterogeneity in ¦Çi. That said, we provide a plausible interpretation by relating ¦Çi to financial constraints and leave the microfoundation of ¦Çi to future research. We conjecture that firms with higher ¦Çi are more financially constrained. It is more costly for these firms to further reduce lower levels of emission intensity since they are financially constrained and since the shadow value of internal funds is high. Such an interpretation is consistent with the empirical finding documented by Xu and Kim (2022) that more financially con- strained firms tend to spend less on abatement costs.COROLLARY 2: Suppose that ¦Çi is drawn from an inverse uniform distribu- tion on the interval [¦Çmin, ¦Çmax] at time 0 and then remains unchanged. The optimal emission intensity ¦Î i? follows a uniform distribution on the interval [¦Îmin?,¦Îmax?].Proof: See the Proof of Corollary 2 in the Internet Appendix.  Corollary 2 shows that the distribution ¦Î i is consistent with the exogenously specified distribution of ¦Î i in our model presented in Section IV.A.  In summary, in this extension we characterize the endogenous choice of emission intensity across firms and provide a microfoundation for higher current profitability among firms with higher emission intensity since high- emission firms save costs associated with pollution abatement and environ- mental recovery. In particular, our model suggests a negative correlation between emission intensity and firms¡¯ abatement costs, consistent with the negative link between emission intensity and measures of abatement costs
The Pollution Premium	39(i.e., ENER and ENRR) in Table VIII. Moreover, our model further provides a testable implication for our empirical analysis in Section III.B.V. Empirical Tests for Regime Change Risk  In this section, we explore the predictions of our model in the data by examining several key testable implications that would support a regime change risk explanation. First, we use the growth in aggregate civil penalties initiated against polluting firms to proxy for the perceived likelihood of an environmental regulation policy change (i.e, regime change risk). Second, we find that regime change risk affects the profitability of high-emission versus low-emission firms in a manner that is consistent with our model assumption. We then implement a GMM test to show that our regime change risk proxy is negatively priced in the cross section of test assets¡¯ returns. Together with a decreasing pattern of emission portfolios¡¯ exposure to regime change risk, we are able to clearly identify the mechanism underlying the pollution premium.A. Our Proxy for Regime Change Risk  To empirically test the regime change risk explanation, we proxy for regime change risk using the annual log growth of aggregate civil penalties initiated against polluting firms in the EPA¡¯s statistics since 1991, ilnt.46 This mea- sure is intuitive, observable, and quantifiable: a larger number of aggregate civil penalties initiated by federal and state governments against polluting firms would suggest an increase in the perceived probability of an environ- mental policy regime change.47 Figure 1 plots the time series of the growth rate (orange line) and the total emissions (blue line).B. Future Profitability and Regime Change Risk  One key premise of our model is that high-emission firms¡¯ future profitability drops following a strengthening of environmental regulations, which impose higher costs on polluting firms. We acknowledge that it is difficult to directly test this premise because our model allows for only one regime change. For fea- sibility¡¯s sake, we test whether high-emission firms¡¯ future profitability drops more when the growth of aggregate civil penalties against pollution increases. To validate this premise, in Table VII we estimateROAi,t+1¡út+10 = a + b1 Emissionsi,t + b2 ilnt + b3 Emissionsi,t ¡Á ilnt   46 These data source are available on the EPA website at: https://echo.epa.gov/facilities/ enforcement-case-search. More details about these data are provided in Section I.B in the In- ternet Appendix. The mean and standard deviation of settlements across all cases are 1.57 and8.93 million dollars (real), respectively.  47 A higher level of aggregate civil penalties can be regarded as a positive signal shock dZ?c as in equation (10), which would lead directly to an increase in the perceived probability of a policy regime change.

This figure plots the time series of total emissions in the EPA¡¯s TRI database (blue line on the left vertical axis) and the log growth in civil penalties (ilnt) (orange line on the right vertical axis).

We interact Emissionsi,t and ilnt to examine the prediction that high-emission firms are more likely to be adversely influenced by regime changes. The vector Controls includes control variables ROA, change in ROA, size, B/M, I/K, TANT, finan- cial constraints, book leverage, and operating leverage in year t, as well as industry-year fixed effects.  Specifications (3) and (4) of Table VII, Panel A report the estimation results for equation (29). The estimated coefficient on the interaction term b?3 is signif- icantly negative, which suggests that firms producing more toxic emissions ob-serve larger profitability decline in the future when regulation is more likely to be tightened. This is consistent with our model setting, and also highlights that the relation between emissions and future profitability is conditional on gov- ernments¡¯ environmental policies and regulations. In contrast, the estimatedcoefficient b?1 on emissions remains significantly positive when we control forthe interaction term; nevertheless, its economic magnitude is fairly small when compared to the interaction term, which is consistent with our model premise that high-emission firms observe lower profits under stronger regulation.
The Pollution Premium	41  Our model also suggests that the pollution premium comes from the varia- tion in cash flow sensitivity to changes in environmental regulations.  To test this prediction, we measure cash flows using the value-weighted future profitability (i.e., moving-average ROA from year t + 1 to t + 10) at the portfolio level and examine whether the cash flows of portfolios with higher emission levels exhibit more negative loadings on regime change risk. Panel B of Table VII shows that the cash flow sensitivity of emission-sorted portfolios displays a downward-sloping pattern, ranging from ?0.31 to ?0.54 with respect to regime change risk. Such a finding again highlights the main economic mechanism in our paper, namely, that high-emission firms carry more negative exposure to regime change risk.C. Market Price and Regime Change Risk Exposure  In this section, we first test the price of regime change risk, which is nega- tive as suggested in equation (20). We then examine emission-sorted portfolios¡¯ exposure to regime change risk. Our model implies a two-factor model in which the market excess return is the first factor and the regime change risk is the second factor. To test the prices of these two factors using the procedure de- tailed in Cochrane (2005) (revised edition, pp. 236?239), we first specify the SDF as                 SDFt = 1 ? ¦Ë ¡Á MKTt ? ¦Ëc ¡Á ilnt.	(30)In equation (30), investors¡¯ marginal utility is driven by two aggregate shocks: MKTt, the market factor in the CAPM, and ilnt, the growth of the logarithmic amount of all civil cases¡¯ penalties as our proxy for regime change risk. We seek to estimate ¦Ëc, which is the sensitivity to ilnt and is proportional to the price of regime change risk ¦Ëc,t in equation (19).  To estimate ¦Ëc, we consider the following test assets: our six emission-sorted portfolios (as presented in Table II), six size-momentum portfolios, and five industry portfolios.48 We then conduct GMM estimation for the following em- pirical approximation to equation (23) (e.g., Kogan and Papanikolaou (2014))E[Re] = ?cov(SDF, Re),	(31)i	ibut with the conditional moments replaced by their unconditional counter- parts. In effect, we assess the ability of ilnt to price test assets on the basis of residuals of the Euler equation.  In addition, we follow the literature (e.g., Papanikolaou (2011), Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou (2013), and Kogan and Papanikolaou (2014)) to estimate two statistics for the cross-sectional fit¡ªthe sum of squared errors (SSQE) and   48 This choice of test assets follows Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken (2010), Belo et al. (2017), Lin, Palazzo, and Yang (2020), and a suggestion from an anonymous reviewer.

42	The Journal of Finance?mean absolute percent errors (MAPE)¡ªas well as the J-statistic of overidenti- fying model restrictions.49 An insignificant J-statistic would suggest that the null hypothesis of an SDF model¡¯s pricing errors being equal to zero is not rejected.  In Panel A of Table X, we present the results of a CAPM and our two-factor SDF model. In Specifications (1) and (2), we separately report the price of regime change risk and market risk. We find that the price of regime change risk ¦Ëc is significantly negative in Specification (1), while the price of mar- ket risk ¦Ë is significantly positive in Specification (2). When we combine the market factor with the regime change risk in Specification (3) as our bench- mark, the price of regime change risk remains significantly negative (?0.99). In terms of asset pricing errors, the SSQE and MAPE of CAPM (Specification(2)) are 2.16% and 8.47%, respectively. After we introduce regime change risk to our model (Specification (3)), the SSQE and MAPE decrease to 1.54% and 6.63%. Although the J-test is statistically insignificant in Specifications (2) and (3), we show that regime change risk still improves the model fit by reducing pricing errors. The JT difference test between the CAPM model and our two- factor model is 2.725 with marginal significance. Overall, regime change risk improves upon the performance of the CAPM model in pricing stock returns.  To differentiate our regime change risk from general political uncertainty, we first compare an alternative two-factor model that includes the market factor and the EPU index of Bloom (2009), which reflects general EPU risk according to Bali, Brown, and Tang (2017). As shown in Specification (4), the estimated price of risk with respect to economic uncertainty is negatively significant, and the JT difference test supports a substantial improvement in pricing when we include the economic uncertainty index in the SDF. In Specification (5), when our regime change risk measure is further considered in the SDF, we find that both the economic uncertainty index and regime shift risk are negatively priced. Finally, in comparison with Specification (4), the inclusion of regime change risk rejects the JT difference test by significantly reducing pricing er- rors. These results thus support the view that our environmental policy risk is distinct from general policy risk.  To further differentiate our regime change risk from aggregate economic growth, we consider an alternative two-factor model that includes the market factor and GDP shocks.50 As shown in Specification (6), the estimated price of risk with respect to GDP shocks is significantly positive, and the JT difference test supports a substantial pricing improvement when we include GDP shocks in the SDF. In Specification (7), when regime change risk is further added to the SDF, we find that it is significantly negatively priced and reduces pricing49 Given the Euler equation E[SDF ¡Á Re] = 0, our SSQE and MAPE are based on each testasset i¡¯s moment error ui as follows: ui =  1 ÒÕT  [S----  ? ?

Our environmental policy risk is thus different from economic growth in asset pricing.  In Panels B to E of Table X, we present emission-sorted portfolios¡¯ risk ex- posure (GMM-implied betas) with respect to various factors in the SDF, to-gether with their alphas estimated from E[Re] ? ¦Âi¦Ë in Specifications (2) to

iWe find that the betas with respect to the mar-
ket factor (¦Âi	) are flat across emission-sorted portfolios in all panels. Moreiimportantly, we observe a decreasing pattern in ¦Âiln from the low-emission portfolio to the high-emission portfolio. These portfolios present a downward- sloping pattern of covariances with our proxy for regime change risk. Taken together, these results support our environmental risk argument that high- emission firms provide higher expected stock returns because they carry more negative betas on regime change risk that is negatively priced. We also find that the addition of regime change risk reduces the economic magnitude and statistical significance of emission portfolios¡¯ alphas when we compare Panels C to B and when we compare Panels E to D. These findings further support our environmental risk argument for the pricing errors associated with emissions.VI. Conclusion  Environmental protection awareness has surged over the past several decades. This paper investigates the implications of industrial pollution on asset pricing. We use firm¡¯s mandatory emission reports filed with EPA to capture firms¡¯ annual toxic releases. A long-short portfolio constructed from firms with high versus low toxic emission intensity relative to their industry peers generates an average excess return of around 4.42% per year. This posi- tive emission-return relation cannot be explained by common risk factors and holds in Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions that control for other firm char- acteristics. When we empirically examine if this positive emission-return rela- tion can be attributed to several explanations proposed in the literature, such as investors¡¯ emission preferences, underreaction to emission abatement, re- tail investors¡¯ behavioral bias, corporate governance, political connections and risk, and other potentially related systematic risks (including technology obso- lescence, financial constraints, economic and political uncertainty, and adjust- ment costs). We find that the return predictability related to toxic emissions cannot be satisfactorily explained by these aforementioned factors.  In additional tests, we find some interesting patterns. First, firms with more toxic emissions are associated with higher current profitability and more envi- ronmental litigation. Second, high-emission firms¡¯ future profitability is lower after governments impose stricter environmental regulations. Third, high- emission firms observe a favorable shock as response to Donald Trump¡¯s 2016U.S. presidential election win, which suggests a connection between emission- related return predictability and changes in environmental policies and   51 In this revision, we modify the code of Kan, Robotti, and Shanken (2013) to calculate test assets¡¯ alphas and t-statistics based on Chapter 12 of Cochrane (2005).
46	The Journal of Finance?regulations. Motivated by these findings, we develop a general equilibrium asset pricing model in which firms¡¯ cash flows face regime change uncertainty with respect to emission regulation policies. We argue that the government optimally replaces a weak regulation regime by a strong one if pollution costs are perceived to be sufficiently high. Since high-emission firms¡¯ profitability is more negatively affected than that of low-emission firms upon a shift from a weak to a strong regulation regime, high-emission firms are more exposed to regulation regime change risk and thus earn higher average excess returns as risk premia. This model is supported by our asset pricing tests: regime change risk is negatively priced, and high-emission firms carry more negative expo- sure to this risk, thereby earning higher risk premia.Initial submission: December 1, 2018; Accepted: January 31, 2022 Editors: Stefan Nagel, Philip Bond, Amit Seru, and Wei XiongREFERENCESAboody, David, and Baruch Lev, 1998, The value relevance of intangibles: The case of software capitalization, Journal of Accounting Research 36, 161?191.Aboody, David, and Baruch Lev, 2000, Information asymmetry, R&D, and insider gains, Journal of Finance 55, 2747?2766.Acemoglu, Daron, 2002, Directed technical change, Review of Economic Studies 69, 781?809.
